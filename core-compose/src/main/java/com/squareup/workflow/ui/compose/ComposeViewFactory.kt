/**
 * Creates a [ViewFactory] that uses a [Composable] function to display the rendering.
 *
 * Note that the function you pass in will not have any `MaterialTheme` applied, so views that rely
 * on Material theme attributes must be explicitly wrapped with `MaterialTheme`.
 *
 * Simple usage:
 *
 * ```
 * // Function references to @Composable functions aren't supported yet.
 * val FooBinding = composedViewFactory { showFoo(it) }
 *
 * @Composable
 * private fun showFoo(foo: FooRendering) {
 *   Text(foo.message)
 * }
 *
 * …
 *
 * val viewRegistry = ViewRegistry(FooBinding, …)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Nesting child renderings
 *
 * Workflows can render other workflows, and renderings from one workflow can contain renderings
 * from other workflows. These renderings may all be bound to their own [ViewFactory]s. Regular
 * [ViewFactory]s and `LayoutRunner`s use
 * [WorkflowViewStub][com.squareup.workflow1.ui.WorkflowViewStub] to recursively show nested
 * renderings using the [ViewRegistry][com.squareup.workflow1.ui.ViewRegistry].
 *
 * View factories defined using this function may also show nested renderings. Doing so is as simple
 * as calling [WorkflowRendering] and passing in the nested rendering. See the kdoc on that function
 * for an example.
 *
 * Nested renderings will have access to any ambients defined in outer composable, even if there are
 * legacy views in between them, as long as the [ViewEnvironment] is propagated continuously between
 * the two factories.
 *
 * ## Initializing Compose context
 *
 * Often all the [composedViewFactory] factories in an app need to share some context – for example,
 * certain ambients need to be provided, such as `MaterialTheme`. To configure this shared context,
 * call [withCompositionRoot] on your top-level [ViewEnvironment]. The first time a
 * [composedViewFactory] is used to show a rendering, its [showRendering] function will be wrapped
 * with the [CompositionRoot]. See the documentation on [CompositionRoot] for more information.
