/**

 * parent, and propagate invalidations, which allows ambients provided around a [WorkflowRendering]
 * call to be read by nested Compose-based view factories.
 *
 * When [WorkflowRendering] is called, it will store an instance of this class in the
 * [ViewEnvironment]. `ComposeViewFactory` pulls the reference out of the environment and uses it to
 * link its composition to the outer one.
