/**
 * This is effectively the logic of [com.squareup.workflow1.ui.WorkflowViewStub], but translated
 * into Compose idioms. This approach has a few advantages:
 *
 *  - Avoids extra custom views required to host `WorkflowViewStub` inside a Composition. Its trick
 *    of replacing itself in its parent doesn't play nice with Compose.
 *  - Allows us to pass the correct parent view for inflation (the root of the composition).
 *  - Avoids `WorkflowViewStub` having to do its own lookup to find the correct [ViewFactory], since
 *    we already have the correct one.
 *
 * Like `WorkflowViewStub`, this function uses the [viewFactory] to create and memoize a [View] to
 * display the [rendering], keeps it updated with the latest [rendering] and [viewEnvironment], and
 * adds it to the composition.
 *
 * This function also passes a [ParentComposition] down through the [ViewEnvironment] so that if the
 * child view further nests any `ComposableViewFactory`s, they will be correctly subcomposed.

/**
 * This is basically a clone of WorkflowViewStub, but it takes an explicit [ViewFactory] instead
 * of looking one up itself, and doesn't do the replace-in-parent trick.
 *
 * It doesn't seem possible to create the view inside a Composable directly and use
 * [AndroidView]. I can't figure out exactly why it doesn't work, but I
 * think it has something to do with getting into an incorrect state if a non-Composable view
 * factory synchronously builds and binds a ComposableViewFactory in buildView. In that case, the
 * second and subsequent compose passes will lose ambients from the parent composition. I've spent
 * a bunch of time trying to debug compose internals and trying different approaches to figure out
 * why that is, but nothing makes sense. All I know is that using a custom view like this seems to
 * fix it.
 *
 * â€¦Except in the case where the highest-level ComposableViewFactory isn't a subcomposition (i.e.
 * the workflow is being ran with setContentWorkflow instead of WorkflowContainer). Or maybe it's
 * only if the top-level ViewFactory is such a ComposableViewFactory, I haven't tested other legacy
 * view factories between the root and the top-level CVF. In that case, there seems to be a race
 * condition with measuring and second compose pass will throw an exception about an unmeasured
 * node.
